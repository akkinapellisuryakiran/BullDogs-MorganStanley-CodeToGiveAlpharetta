#### Please feel free to update this with things you'd like me to work on.

- So far I have added a very basic login page.
- I may have spent entirely too long on the signup, mentor dash, and mentee dash pages, but I am happy with them.

- For the mentor dash page, it would ideally poll the database and return the mentees assigned to that mentor, also returning the mentee's location and interests. Also, if the mentee has a profile picture it would pull that to show on the dash. The profile picture would be clickable to take the mentor to the mentees summary page, the mentor would also be able to send a message from that page.

- For the mentee dash page, it would work simlarly to the mentor page, however, the mentee should be limited to a maximum number of mentors. This is to ensure that the mentee is able to get enough quality mentoring time with their mentor.

- The sign up page would allow mentors or mentees to sign up with their email address or by using the various social network APIs to allows for a user to signup with and link their social profiles. Mainly looking at the LinkedIn API since this would be a good platform to work with for the mentor to help with mentee grow their professional network.

- The login and questions pages currently is very basic, I will improve upon that during my next session. I plan on making the login page look similar to the signup page.

- For the questions, since this platform is being targeted towards 9^th^ and 10^th^ graders, they may not know what they want in the STEAM(Science, tech, engineering, arts, and math) fields. So we should offer them the choice between a questionaire or through an interactive lifesyles activity. The questionaire should dynamically pull questions based on how the previous question was answered. 
    - The interactive lifestyles activity should be similar to a choose your own path adventure, where the mentee signing up would role play as their character and respond to various activites that are determined through a brief introductory phase at the begining.
